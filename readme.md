we are working on "OverSim-20121206". 

Dependencies 
1. "omnetpp-4.2.2-src-windows" version of omnet++. 
2. "inet-20111118-src" version of inet.

Objective 
To try and compare the performance of DQ-DHT and traditional approaches of querying on Chord overlay for the queries that do not exactly
fit the query model of Chord. Number of nodes in the netowork, degree of churn, propagartion delay and the frequency of Stabalize/fix-fingers
will be used to compare the performances.
